The weather refers to the temporary and local conditions of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, including phenomena such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind, precipitation, and other meteorological elements (Source: National Weather Service).\n\nIf you're looking for current or forecasted weather information, I recommend checking reputable sources such as:\n\n1. National Weather Service (NWS) - provides up-to-date weather forecasts, warnings, and conditions.\n2. AccuWeather - offers detailed weather forecasts, news, and analysis.\n3. BBC Weather - provides weather forecasts, warnings, and advice for the UK and around the world.\n\nThese sources can provide more accurate and reliable information on current or forecasted weather conditions.",
